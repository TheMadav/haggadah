%\chapter*{Preface to the 2013 edition}
%
%During my undergraduate years, the annual cobbling-together of a haggadah from
%assorted prayer books, Maxwell House freebies and miscellaneous online snippets
%grew into a kind of March ritual. The haggadah, once constructed and
%wine-baptized, was invariably lost---and, in an echo of the pagan springtime
%ceremony from which Passover likely derives, refashioned anew each year.  This
%document is an attempt to stabilize the process (or, at the very least, to
%minimize the amount of frantic typing I have to do after dinner goes into the
%oven).
%
%Every haggadah is a palimpsest, but this one more than most. Its immediate
%progenitor, which I refer to here as the ``Commune Haggadah'', was used in 2011
%and 2012 (and possibly earlier?) by an eponymous collective of Columbia students
%who identified (some ironically and some with deadly seriousness) with various
%worldwide socialist movements. The Commune Haggadah appears to have itself been
%substantially plagiarized from an earlier ``Socialist Haggadah'' (with the full
%cooperation of the latter's author), about which I have been able to determine
%only that it was prepared by a friend-of-a-friend, one Eve Goodman, from an
%intimidating list of scholarly sources (enumerated on the back pages) between
%the years 2003 and 2010. The lost haggadot which I prepared for my own use in
%2010 and 2011 were rather more catholic (note the miniscule ``c''!) in the
%themes and political leanings of their source material.
%
%This is not a socialist haggadah.  Though we eat reclining, the seder is
%supposed to make us uncomfortable: our meal recalls Jews' tears and Egyptians'
%blood; bricks and affliction; mortar and slaughter. And the ``telling'' for
%which this book is named ought to make us uncomfortable too, no less when that
%means avoiding easy (and, we can now safely say, demonstrably untrue) Marxist
%accounts of history. Nevertheless the basic story of the Passover is the
%liberation of the oppressed by overwhelming historical forces, and the basic
%impulse of the Commune Haggadah was good. It, and its predecessors, still
%constitute the spiritual (if no longer the textual) core of the present
%document. I can only hope that, transplanted with its keeper, the Haggadah now
%hold will flourish as we have in Cambridge's strange soil.

  The passover seder as we know it, however, actually originated in late
  antiquity, in Roman Palestine in the first centuries of the Common Era. That
  historical context is very important because both the very structure and
  format of the haggadah text reflects not only those conventions but also the
  inevitable cultural changes that occurred when Jews moved from Roman Palestine
  to other cultures in the Diaspora [\ldots]

  Let me give one brief example: The passage that we know as the Four
  Questions originally consisted of three, not four questions, and each question
  directly addressed one of the three symbolic foods eaten at the seder---the
  maror (which are the bitter herbs customarily eaten with \d{h}aroset) the
  matzah, and the Passover sacrifice. As it happens, each of these three foods
  also related to the three courses that were customarily eaten at a Greco-Roman
  banquet.

  According to one tradition, we recite this portion in Aramaic rather than
  Hebrew so that the angels (who can't understand Aramaic) don't take us up on
  our offer and crash the party.

  Various reasons are given for breaking the middle matzah: to remind us that
  the task of liberation, like the matzah, is incomplete; or in commemoration of
  the time when we were poor and hungry. Another commentary tells us that the
  Hebrew slaves, making their way to freedom, couldn't know when their next meal
  would come, so they would eat a small amount and hide the rest for later.

\begin{HgEnglish}
  It is written [Deut. xvi. 3]: ``Bread of affliction'' (le\d{h}em oni), and as
  ``oni'' can also stand for ``proclaiming,'' the bread may be called ``bread of
  proclamation,'' i.e., ``bread over which proclamations should be made,'' and
  thus we have also learned [from the Oral Law]. Or ``Oni'' may still be called
  ``poor,'' and for the reason that the benediction pertaining to the eating of
  the unleavened bread should be made over a broken piece after the manner of
  the poor.

This invitation appears to be presented at the wrong time, for Kiddush has

own homes, and in a language, Aramaic, which most people no longer understand.
[\ldots] What purpose do these invitations serve?

The Pesach Seder is a celebration of our redemption and we are all guests of
honor. To prevent the guests from feeling beholden to [host,] which would
inhibit their involvement and participation in the evening, we begin the Seder
by allowing the guests to invite others. The Talmud states "a guest is not
permitted to invite other guests". However, a guest of honor has the right to
invite whomever he chooses. The message we are relaying to all the participants
is they are not merely guests beholden to the homeowner. Rather, they are all
guests of honor, celebrating their own redemption. [\ldots] The purpose of the
invitation is for the guests already assembled, not for those who are absent.

It happened that Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah, Rabbi
Akiva and Rabbi Tarphon were reclining [at a seder] in B'nei Berak. They were
discussing the exodus from Egypt all that night, until their students came and
told them: ``Masters! The time has come for reciting the morning Sh'ma!''

Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah said: I have lived to be a man of threescore years and
ten, yet I did not understand why the story of the Exodus should be told at
night until Ben Zoma explained it to me. He said: It is said, ``That thou mayest
remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of
thy life.'' (Deuteronomy 16:3) ``The days of your life'' would have meant the
days only, but ``all the days of your life'' includes the nights also.  The
Sages of Israel explain it further: ``The days of your life'' refers to this
world, while ``All the days of your life'' includes the time of the Messiah.

To that one, you explain all the laws of Passover, down to the very last detail

The wicked child asks: ``What does all of this mean to you?'' (Exodus 12:26)

By saying ``you,'' and not ``we'' or ``me,'' he excludes himself from the group,
and denies God. Answer that child plainly: ``This is done because of what the
Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.'' (Exodus 13:8) ``For me, not for you:
if you had been there in Egypt, you would not have been redeemed.''\\[1em]
The simple child asks: ``What is this?'' 

Answer that one: ``By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, from
the house of bondage.'' (Exodus 13:14)\\[1em]
To the child who does not know how to ask, speak first, it is written: ``And
thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which

  The Torah records the song we sang as we crossed the red sea. One of the
  best-known verses begins ``{\itshape Mi \d{h}amo\d{ha} ba'elim,
Adonai?}''---``Who is like you Lord, among all the gods?'' But the correct
Hebrew is {\itshape kamo\d{h}a}, not {\itshape \d{h}amo\d{h}a}. It's said that
when the Jews first came to the shore the sea didn't part, but one man entered
the water singing. {\itshape Mi \d{h}amo\d{h}a} is the sound of him beginning to
choke on the water; only after he was fully submerged did the sea begin to part.

Rabbi Yosi the Gallilean said: How do you know that the Egyptians were stricken

In Egypt it says of them, "The magicians said to Pharaoh `This is the finger of
God.' At the sea it says, "Israel saw the great hand that the Lord laid against
Egypt; and the people feared the L-rd, and they believed in the Lord and in His
servant Moses."

Now, how often were they smitten by `the finger'? Ten plagues!

Thus you must conclude that in Egypt they were smitten by ten plagues, at the

\begin{HgEnglish}
In most families, it is customary to hide the matzah during {\bfseries
ya\d{h}atz}. At this point in the evening the children search for the matzah,
and a prize is awarded to the one who finds it.

Traditionally, it's even less straightforward. The seder cannot proceed until
the afikoman has been eaten, and so the child who holds it finds herself with an
excelleng bargaining token. Rather than simply being given a prize, she uses the
matzah to extort a gift of her choosing from the adults.

  As mentioned before, the structure of the Passover seder appears to be

In the latter case they have a ceased to think about the Paschal lamb; when they
awake it is as though they would eat in two different places, sleep breaking the
continuity of action and place, and thus it is forbidden.

\HgSource{Soncino Babylonian Talmud}
\end{HgEnglish}

\HgFill

\begin{HgEnglish}
The Afikomen is hidden away during Yachatz (division ceremony) at the beginning
of the Seder. Many families have the custom to allow the children to steal the
Afikomen. If we are trying to teach our children about Torah, how can we teach
them to steal?! The Afikomen represents the future redemption which is hidden
from us. Matzah, which must be eaten only after eating an appetizer to make us
hungry, represents a passion for truth. Eliyahu HaNavi, whom we symbolically
welcome with a fifth cup of wine on Seder-night, ``will return the heart of the
parents to the children and the children to the parents.'' The ``gap'' that
prevents one generation from relating to a previous one is our biggest problem.
When a generation takes the potential they have been given, and misappropriates
it by not applying it to Torah which is the one thing that can help us bridge
the gap between all past generations, they are stealing our future hope. We want
our children to steal the Afikomen instead; they should crave the ``quest'' for
Torah, represented by the matzah of the Afikomen, so that our final hidden
redemption can be revealed.

  It was at Passover time in 1943 that the Warsaw Ghetto uprising took place. On
  that day, April 19th, began the revolt against the Nazis who had come into the
  Ghetto of Warsaw to complete the deportation of the remaining Jews. 40,000
  civilians were led by the Jewish Fighting Organization, several hundred young
  women and men armed with ancient guns and home-made Molotov cocktails.
  Confined in a small area of the Ghetto, they were unable to maneuver beyond a
  few city blocks. The leadership perished in the bunker at 18 Mila Street on
  May 8th; no one surrendered. For weeks thereafter, small groups of resistance
  fighters emerged to battle the Nazis from behind rubble and wreckage.
  Resistance continued until the Nazis burned the entire Ghetto to the ground in
  September 1943 - six months after the uprising began.

   In the diaspora, this craving for revenge was both understandable and
   ineffective. But the founding of the state of Israel has changed the
   situation completely. In Israel, Jews are far from being defenseless. We
   don’t have to rely on God to take revenge for the evils done unto us, past or
   present, real or imagined. We can pour out our wrath ourselves, on our
   neighbours, the Palestinians and other Arabs, on our minorities, on our
   victims.

   That is the real danger of the Haggadah, as I see it. It was written by and
   for helpless Jews living in perpetual danger. It raised their spirits once a
   year, when they felt safe for a moment, protected by their God, surrounded by
   their families

   %Taken out of this context and applied to a new, completely different
   %situation, it can set us on an evil course. Telling ourselves that everybody
   %is out to destroy us, yesterday and most certainly tomorrow, we consider the
   %grandiloquent bombast of an Iranian bigmouth as a living proof of the
   %validity of the old maxim. They are out to kill us, so we must – according to
   %another ancient Jewish injunction – kill them first.

   \HgEllipsis{} So, on this Seder evening, let our feelings be guided by the

Three thousand years ago, a farmer arose in the Middle East who challenged the

movement and created a legend which would inspire generations to come.

Elijah declared that he would return once each generation in the guise of
someone poor or oppressed, coming to people's doors to see how he would be
treated. Thus would he know whether or not humanity had become ready to
participate in the dawn of the Messianic age. He is said to visit every seder,
and sip there from his cup of wine.

\begin{HgEnglish}
  Today we know that there is no Messiah coming; we must be our own Messiahs,
  bringing our own redemption and liberation, just as the Jews brought
  themselves out of Egypt and into freedom. So while we continue to open the
  door for any who care to come in, Elijah’s cup is to be drunk by all who wish
  to at the Seder tonight; for we must sustain ourselves in our ongoing
  struggles.

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
  For once when I cried out somebody listened: \\
  The Lord took my complaint for a song \\
  Belted at the top of my lungs \\
  In a shower of troubles, good  \\
  Even if off key. Surrounded by death \\
  Loving liars, by fires banked inside \\
  My nature, I stumbled over simple things: \\
  A shoe untied, the pillow never smooth, \\
  A night cough, hum of strangers' tires.

  The gift has been given. So, low but alive, \\
  I said what I believed: that greed succeeds \\
  Where grace can not, that one idea can kill \\
  A world of simple pleasures, cup and spoon. \\
  Stir them. Don't speak quickly, savor \\
  The hot cider, candied ginger on the tongue,  \\
  Heavy cloud shrugged off my shoulders. \\
  I promise to be more than one of those \\
  (What, still alive? He lived? He died?) who never \\
  Show their heart or read the lips of mumblers \\
  In the public record: I call upon the Lord, \\
  Am called upon, to praise in easy words: \\
  A truth should come out plain and make good sense, \\
  So truth will find a friendly audience.
